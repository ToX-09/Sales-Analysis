# Sales Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to use SQL to perform business-oriented analysis on a fictional sales dataset. It simulates a real-world scenario where a company tracks sales data across departments and employees.

## 📁 Dataset

**File:** `employee_sales.csv`  
The dataset contains 200 entries with the following columns:
- `EmployeeID`
- `Department`
- `SaleAmount`
- `SaleDate`

## 🧠 Key SQL Queries

1. **Total Sales by Department**  
   View how much each department contributed in total sales.

2. **Employee Performance Report**  
   Analyze which employees made the most sales and revenue.

3. **Monthly Sales Trends**  
   Observe sales performance over each month in 2023.

4. **Average Sale by Department**  
   Calculate the mean sale value for each department.

5. **High-Volume Employees**  
   Find employees who made more than one sale.

All SQL scripts can be found in the `sql_queries/` folder.

## 📊 (Optional) Dashboard

You can visualize these queries using Power BI or Tableau to build a dynamic sales dashboard.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Import the CSV file into your SQL database.
2. Run the queries inside the `sql_queries` folder.
3. Optionally, use the results to create visuals or dashboards.
